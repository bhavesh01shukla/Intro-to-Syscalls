1.input format for q1 is:
-> ./a.out  file_path

2.new file has permissions 600
3.new directory named "Assignment" has permissions 700

4. input format for q2 is:
-> ./a.out  oldfile_path  newfile_path  directory_path 	

5.I have used perror() mostly for error handling.

6.Whether file contents are reversed in newfile?
I am checking this at last.
